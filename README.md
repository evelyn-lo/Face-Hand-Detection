# face_detection

This project implements real-time hand gesture recognition and a googly eyes filter using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and deep learning techniques. Due to the extensive number of libraries, models, and image data used to train the hand gesture model, only the edited files related to the googly eyes filter and hand gesture training are included.

# Project Overview:
Googly Eyes Filter: Utilizes ibf_face_landmarks to detect facial features and applies a googly eyes filter over the detected positions using object-oriented programming (OOP).

# Hand Gesture Recognition: 
Hand gestures like rock, paper, and scissors are recognized through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The model identifies and boxes hand gestures from live video feed, determining the corresponding gesture (rock, paper, or scissors) based on posture analysis.
